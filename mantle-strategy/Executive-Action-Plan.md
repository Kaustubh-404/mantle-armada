## 💰 Revenue Projection (Optional, for pitch)

### Conservative Case
```
Month 1: 100 DAU × $50 lifetime spend = $5,000
Month 2: 1,000 DAU × $100 lifetime = $100,000
Month 3: 5,000 DAU × $150 lifetime = $750,000

Year 1 Total: ~$2.5M revenue
```

### With Bonds/Yields
```
$5M AUM at year-end
5% transaction volume = $250k monthly
```

## 🎬 Marketing Messaging

### For Hacakthon Judges
**Elevator Pitch (60 seconds):**
> "AVAX Armada is a play-to-earn naval strategy game on Mantle that combines engaging GameFi with social network effects through guilds and an $ARMADA token economy. Players form communities, participate in seasonal battle passes, and can soon tokenize their ships as yield-bearing financial assets. We're showcasing Mantle's ability to handle micro-transactions and complex state management while building the foundation for compliant RWA derivatives."

### For Gaming Community
> "Join a naval empire, command your crew, battle rivals, and build wealth. Earn $ARMADA tokens through gameplay, join a guild, and watch your ships generate passive income."

### For DeFi Enthusiasts
> "Experience the future of gaming-as-finance. Trade ships, issue bonds, generate yield, and participate in a fully on-chain economy. Play to earn, stake to yield, bond to leverage."

## 🚀 What Makes This Different

### vs. Other GameFi
- ✅ We have social (guilds + chat) - they don't
- ✅ We have yield strategy - they have just farming
- ✅ We show RWA path - they're game-only

### vs. Other Mantle Submissions
- ✅ We're consumer-facing (playable, viral) - most are infrastructure
- ✅ We show speed advantage - batch operations showcase Mantle's throughput
- ✅ We align with RWA track - most are DeFi-only

### Why Judges Will Remember You
> "The team that made a game people actually want to play, built community mechanics, showed serious token economics, AND has a credible path to RWA compliance. Plus they actually deployed it and got users playing on day one."

## 📞 Decision Point Questions

**If you're unsure, ask:**

1. **"Should I skip guilds and focus on just migrating?"**
   - NO. Guilds are 40% of your competitive advantage.

2. **"Do I need the RWA roadmap for the hackathon?"**
   - YES. It's a differentiator. Even if not built, the vision matters.

3. **"What if I don't finish everything?"**
   - Prioritize: Guild > Token > Battle Pass > Social UI > NFTs

4. **"Should I do Mantle + Avalanche for comparison?"**
   - NO. Focus on Mantle. Show you understand their ecosystem deeply.

5. **"How much can I copy from my existing AVAX version?"**
   - 80% of core logic stays the same. New additions: guilds, token, battle pass, social.
